Summary (your intent, distilled)

You track ~318 Solana wallets (a mix of consistently profitable + high-activity traders).

Goal: learn each wallet’s trading “fingerprint” (win rate, entry size, hold time, target multiple, etc.) from on-chain behavior on Pump.fun pairs, then use that profile in a Rust execution bot to front-run exits and size entries accordingly.

Pipeline:

1-Live ingest (Rust) via your local Agave + Yellowstone gRPC: listen for Pump.fun interactions from the tracked wallets; persist rich trade events to SQLite.

2-Offline analysis (Python/TS): crunch features per wallet/day + lifetime, detect copy-trader networks, write “patterns” back into SQLite.

3-Execution bot (Rust): when a tracked leader buys, look up their pattern and auto-decide entry size, slippage, exit clock/targets, and sell before their historical exit window.

Data model (SQLite schema you can drop in)

1. wallets – you already have this
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS wallets (
   wallet TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
   alias TEXT,
   is_tracked INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
   notes TEXT,
   created_at INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT (strftime('%s','now'))
   );
   CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_wallets_tracked ON wallets(is_tracked);

2. raw*events – immutable, append-only facts from gRPC (normalize everything here)
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS raw_events (
   id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
   ts_ns INTEGER NOT NULL, -- chain slot-time if available; else local recv
   slot INTEGER,

   );
   CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_raw_events_wallet_ts ON raw_events(wallet, ts_ns);
   CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_raw_events_mint_ts ON raw_events(mint, ts_ns);

3. trades – stitch multi-ix transactions into logical trades; compute realized P&L when closed
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS trades (
   trade_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
   wallet TEXT NOT NULL,
   mint TEXT NOT NULL,
   open_sig TEXT NOT NULL,
   open_ts_ns INTEGER NOT NULL,
   open_qty REAL NOT NULL,

   leader_score REAL, -- predictive “leader” strength
   preferred_time_window TEXT, -- hours/UTC where they’re most active
   updated_at INTEGER NOT NULL
   );

5. follow_edges – copy-trader network (who reliably buys after whom)
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS follow_edges (
   leader TEXT NOT NULL,
   follower TEXT NOT NULL,
   lag_ms_p50 INTEGER,

   avg_follower_size_sol REAL,
   PRIMARY KEY (leader, follower)
   );

Ingestion (Rust) — practical details
Stream: Yellowstone gRPC SubscribeTransactions (and/or SubscribeAccountUpdates if you need pool/account states).

Filter:

Program ID(s) for Pump.fun & its AMM route(s).

signers ∩ tracked_wallets ≠ ∅.

Decode: map instructions into semantic actions: CREATE, BUY, SELL (or AMM SWAP). Extract mint, amounts, and best-effort prices (derive from pool reserves at slot or from event logs).

Latency clocks: store both chain/slot timestamp (if available) and your local receive time to let you compute true end-to-end later.

Write model: batch inserts into SQLite (WAL mode, synchronous=NORMAL, prepared statements). Consider an optional “daily roll” to Parquet or DuckDB for heavy analytics later, but keep SQLite as the single source of truth for the bot.

SQLite pragmas to set on startup:
PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;
PRAGMA synchronous=NORMAL;
PRAGMA temp_store=MEMORY;
PRAGMA mmap_size=268435456; -- 256MB, tune per box
PRAGMA cache_size=-262144; -- ~256MB in pages

Offline analytics (Python/TypeScript) — what to compute

For each wallet (rolling daily + lifetime):

Activity: trades/day, session windows (UTC hours), burstiness.

Sizing: median/mean entry size (SOL), distribution (p50/p90).

Hold: p50/p90 hold time (ms).

Targets: realized multiples p50/p90 (0.3x losers, 1.2x, 1.5x, 2x etc.); estimate exit style

time-stop (sells after fixed time),

target-x (exits near fixed multiples),

panic-dump (sells shortly after adverse move),

scale-out (multiple partial sells).

Execution quality: empirical slippage distribution (compute effective price vs mid).

Performance: win rate, avg PnL/trade/day, volatility of returns.

Consistency: stability of the above across weeks (e.g., EWMA).

Store back into wallet_patterns.

Detecting copy-trader networks (leader/follower)

For each leader candidate L and other wallet W:

collect sequences of L’s buy times on a given mint.

compute the probability W buys the same mint within Δ ∈ {2s, 5s, 10s, 30s} after L.

estimate lag distribution (p50/p90) and conditional probability vs baseline.

define follow_prob = P(W buys within 5s | L buys) minus baseline P(W buys any mint in 5s).

Write records to follow_edges.

Aggregate followership_score for a leader as a weighted sum of their edges (closer, higher-prob followers count more).

Execution bot (Rust) — decision policy (deterministic & simple first)

When a tracked leader buys:

Lookup wallet_patterns (and follow_edges for that leader).

Decide entry:

size = clamp( leader.avg_entry_sol × α , min, max )

slippage = max(your base, leader.slippage_pctl_95 × β)

only buy if expected value positive with your exit rule.

Set exit based on leader’s fingerprint:

If leader typical exit is time_stop: set timer = 0.6 × p50_hold_ms (aim to clear before they likely dump).

If target_x: set TP at min(0.8 × p50_target_x, 0.5 × p90_target_x).

Always include max_hold_ms = p90_hold_ms as a safety kill.

Risk & hygiene:

per-trade SOL cap, per-hour loss cap, per-mint concurrency cap (avoid over-exposure), blocklist sketchy mints.

fail-safe “cancel & market-out” on mempool stall or adverse slippage.

Routing:

Prefer TPU submit; when you get Jito access, send both: one bundle (MEV) + a TPU fallback.

Feedback: write your fills into trades, update realized PnL; the analytics job will learn from your actual outcomes too.

Core algorithms (clear and implementable)

A. Trade stitching (from raw_events → trades)

For a (wallet, mint), the first BUY starts a trade; aggregate partial buys until a SELL reduces position to ~0 (tolerance).

On SELL, compute matched PnL (FIFO or weighted average).

Keep partial scale-out as either a new trade leg or as a single trade with sub-fills in meta_json.

B. Hold time & targets

hold_ms = close_ts_ns - open_ts_ns

p50_hold_ms, p90_hold_ms by quantiles over last N trades (N≥50 preferred).

target_x = close_proceeds_sol / open_cost_sol (for matched qty). Quantiles idem.

C. Slippage

slippage = (exec_price - reference_price) / reference_price.

Reference = pool mid at slot or VWAP over ±1s window; pick one consistently.

D. Leader–Follower

For each leader buy (L, mint, tL), search followers’ buys on same mint in [tL, tL+T].

Build empirical CDF of lag_ms; compute enrichment vs baseline using bootstrapping to avoid false positives.

Only keep edges with follow_prob ≥ 0.3 and ≥ K co-occurrences (e.g., K≥5).

Rust module breakdown (so you can scaffold fast)

grpc_subscriber: connect + filters + backpressure.

decoder: map Pump.fun ix → semantic events; pool snapshots for price.

writer: SQLite prepared statements + batcher.

ledger_cache (optional): tiny in-mem cache of recent pool states by slot.

exec_signals: subscribe to your own condition streams (e.g., leader BUY).

strategy: implements the decision rules above.

tx_builder: build swap/route txns; configurable slippage & deadlines.

submitter: TPU now; add Jito bundle path later.

monitor: confirm, record fills, PnL, and emit telemetry.

config: TOML for runtime params; hot-reload if you like.

Example: pattern-driven decision (pseudocode)
fn on_leader_buy(leader: Pubkey, mint: Pubkey, price: f64, now_ns: i128) {
let pat = db.load_wallet_pattern(&leader)?;
if pat.sample_trades < 50 || pat.win_rate < 0.52 { return; } // quality gate

    let size_sol = clamp(pat.avg_entry_sol * 0.75, 0.2, 3.0);
    let slip_bp  = max(BASE_SLIP_BP, (pat.slippage_pctl_95 * 1.2) as i32);

    let tp_mult  = f64::min(0.8 * pat.p50_target_x, 0.5 * pat.p90_target_x)
                    .max(1.05); // require at least +5%
    let t_exit_ms = (0.6 * pat.p50_hold_ms as f64) as i64;
    let t_kill_ms = pat.p90_hold_ms;

    if expected_value(tp_mult, slip_bp, fees) <= 0.0 { return; }

    let tx = build_swap_tx(mint, size_sol, slip_bp, DEADLINE_SECS);
    submit_via_tpu_or_bundle(tx);
    schedule_exit(mint, tp_mult, t_exit_ms, t_kill_ms);

}

Practical guardrails & ops
Schema migrations: version your DB (table schema_info(version INT)), write small migrators.

Clock sanity: record both slot and local receive times; keep NTP in sync.

Backfill: optional script to hydrate historical trades for these wallets to speed up learning.

Unit tests: feed canned Pump.fun txns to decoder; assert decoded amounts & actions.

Telemetry: emit Prometheus (or simple CSV) for: ingest lag, write QPS, error rates, EV per leader, PnL per day.

Minimal SQL to get analytics off the ground
Win rate & median hold per wallet (illustrative):
-- window of last 500 trades per wallet
WITH t AS (
SELECT * FROM trades
WHERE close_ts_ns IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY open_ts_ns DESC
LIMIT 500
)
SELECT wallet,
AVG(was_win)*1.0 AS win_rate,
(SELECT hold_ms
FROM t t2
WHERE t2.wallet=t1.wallet AND t2.hold_ms IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY hold_ms
LIMIT 1 OFFSET (SELECT COUNT(\*)/2 FROM t t3 WHERE t3.wallet=t1.wallet)
) AS p50_hold_ms
FROM t t1
GROUP BY wallet;
(You’ll likely compute quantiles in Python and write them back; SQLite quantiles are clunky.)

Suggested first milestones (you can implement straight away)
Ingest MVP: Rust gRPC subscriber → decode Pump.fun BUY/SELL → write raw_events.

Trade stitcher: derive trades with hold time + basic PnL.

Analytics v1: Python script computes win_rate, p50/p90 hold, avg_entry_sol, p50/p90 target_x → write wallet_patterns.

Follower graph v1: simple Δ=5s co-occurrence → write follow_edges.

Execution MVP: on leader BUY, query wallet_patterns, place small-size entry, timer exit.

Risk switches: global “red button,” per-day loss cap, per-mint exposure cap.

Tuning loop: compare expected vs realized; adjust α/β sizing/slippage and exit rule.

if you want, I can also generate:

a printable PDF “system spec” with the diagrams & DDL,

a Rust crate scaffold (module stubs + SQLite layer),

a Python notebook that ingests from SQLite and fills wallet_patterns and follow_edges.

tell me which deliverable you want first and I’ll produce it now.

Okay, beautiful breakdown. The last thing I need from you is the folder structure. How should I structure my project? That's number one. Number two, I also need you to list the tools that I need to use. Other than the programming languages, do I need to use PandaFun IDL, some SDKs, things like that for all of the tools, like for all of the bots, like for the data collection bot, for the execution bot. Do I need to, you know, like how do I structure the project? And also, what other tools do I need other than the programming languages, right? This is number one. Number two is that the wallets that I have, they're stored in SQLite data table, right, or database. But since it's better for performance and speed to use Postgres, we can store the new information to the Postgres, right? But since the wallets are stored in the SQLite database, we can take them from the SQLite database. Also, the wallets table in the wallets DB, there are different tables inside the database. There is a wallets table that has all the wallets. And next to the wallets, each name for the wallet. Because I know those traders, you know, they're public traders. So each wallet has its name, right? So I want the, you know, I want the bot to not only take their wallets from the SQL table, but also take their names. And then, you know, once it fetches or once it listens to the new transactions happening on the blockchain, it will store them with their names, with their, like, transactions on a new database that we will create using Postgres SQL, right? That's my thoughts.

Perfect — you’re thinking about the right split: folder structure + tools/SDKs + DB migration (SQLite → Postgres). Let me give you a concrete plan.

📂 Project Folder Structure

A clean way to organize is monorepo style with each bot/tool in its own crate/module but shared libraries for DB + decoding.

This lets you:

Keep live ingestion (Rust), offline analytics (Python), and execution bot (Rust) separate.

Reuse db crate across ingestion + exec bot.

Store SQL migrations in one place so you can rebuild Postgres or SQLite easily.

Keep configs + secrets out of code.

🛠 Tools & SDKs You’ll Need
Rust side (data collection + execution bot)

Rust crates:

tokio
(async runtime).

tonic
(gRPC client, works with Yellowstone).

prost
(protobuf codegen for Yellowstone protos).

serde + serde_json
(for JSON in DB).

sqlx
OR diesel
(SQLite + Postgres support).

chrono
(time handling).

log + env_logger
(logging).

config
(parse TOML configs).

Pump.fun program decoding:

You’ll need the Pump.fun IDL (Anchor JSON file).

It gives you struct layouts for decode.

Can load via anchor-lang in Rust or parse JSON manually.

Alternatively, use Solana SDK crates (solana-sdk, solana-program) to decode accounts/ix.

For price math, you might need the Raydium/AMM SDK if Pump.fun routes through it.

Transaction submission:

solana-client
for RPC fallback.

solana-tpu-client
for TPU mode.

jito-proto
(when you get Jito access).

Python side (analytics tools)

pandas (fast aggregations).

sqlalchemy (DB connector for Postgres + SQLite).

numpy, scipy (stats).

matplotlib or seaborn (plots).

networkx (leader/follower graph analysis).

duckdb (optional: super-fast queries if you dump raw_events to Parquet).

Databases

SQLite (lightweight ingest, already in place).

Postgres (scalable analytics + execution bot backend).

Use pgloader or your own script to migrate wallets from SQLite → Postgres.

Keep wallets table identical, with name column so you always associate transactions with aliases.

Other tooling

Migrations: sqlx migrate
or [diesel migrations].

Task runner: justfile or makefile for common commands.

Containerization (optional): Docker Compose for Postgres + Prometheus.

Monitoring: Grafana + Prometheus if you want metrics on ingest latency, trades, PnL.

🗄 SQLite → Postgres Strategy

Keep wallets in SQLite as seed (since you already have it).

Write a small script (scripts/seed_wallets.py) that reads from wallets.db and inserts into Postgres.

Include wallet + name columns.

Switch all new data (raw_events, trades, wallet_patterns, follow_edges) to Postgres.

Better for concurrency, analytics, indexing.

Hybrid setup:

SQLite only for reference (wallet list).

Postgres for live ingestion + analysis + execution.

Example: Python seeding script
import sqlite3, psycopg2

sqlite_conn = sqlite3.connect("wallets.db")
pg_conn = psycopg2.connect("dbname=copytrader user=postgres password=...")

src = sqlite_conn.cursor()
dst = pg_conn.cursor()

src.execute("SELECT wallet, name FROM wallets")
rows = src.fetchall()

for wallet, name in rows:
dst.execute(
"INSERT INTO wallets (wallet, alias) VALUES (%s, %s) ON CONFLICT (wallet) DO NOTHING",
(wallet, name)
)

pg_conn.commit()

✅ Answer to your two questions:

Folder structure → use a monorepo with separate crates for gRPC ingestion, execution bot, DB, and offline Python analytics. Keep SQL schema + migrations under /sql.

Tools beyond languages → you’ll need:

Pump.fun IDL (for decoding).

Solana SDK crates (Rust).

Optional Raydium/AMM SDK if Pump.fun uses it.

Jito protos for bundle submission.

SQLite (seed wallets) + Postgres (main DB).

Python data stack (pandas, sqlalchemy, networkx).
