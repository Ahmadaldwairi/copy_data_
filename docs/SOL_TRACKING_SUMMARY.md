# SOL Tracking Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

## Overview

Successfully integrated comprehensive SOL amount tracking and live price fetching into the Pump.fun copytrader bot. The bot now captures complete trading data including SOL spent/received and USD values.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Live SOL Price Fetching

- **Module**: `crates/common/src/sol_price.rs`
- **API**: CoinGecko free API (`https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/price`)
- **Update Frequency**: Every 10 seconds via background tokio task
- **Caching**: Arc<RwLock<f64>> for thread-safe access
- **Features**:
  - Automatic initialization on bot startup
  - Background price updates
  - Cached price access (no blocking API calls during transaction processing)

### 2. SOL Balance Tracking

- **Pre/Post Balance Extraction**: From transaction metadata
- **Wallet Index Detection**: Finds wallet position in account_keys array
- **Balance Change Calculation**:
  - Negative change = SOL spent (BUY trade)
  - Positive change = SOL received (SELL trade)
- **Lamports Conversion**: `amount_sol = lamports / 1_000_000_000.0`

### 3. Enhanced Data Structure

Updated `raw_events` table storage:

- **amount_in**: Token amount (raw token units)
- **amount_out**: SOL amount (spent on BUY, received on SELL)
- **price_est**: Current SOL/USD price at time of trade
- **fee_sol**: Transaction fee in SOL

### 4. USD Value Calculation

Real-time USD values computed for all trades:

```rust
usd_value = sol_amount * sol_price
```

## Verification - Live Capture Example

**Transaction**: 64PLDdcr... (captured 2025-10-17 02:13:17 UTC)

```
Action: BUY
Wallet: DEdEW3SM...
Tokens: 9,199,996,311,068
SOL Spent: 2.1270 SOL
SOL Price: $185.42
USD Value: $394.40
Fee: 0.070005 SOL
```

**Database Verification**:

```sql
SELECT action, amount_in, amount_out, price_est, fee_sol
FROM raw_events
WHERE amount_out IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY ts_ns DESC LIMIT 1;

 action |   amount_in   | amount_out | price_est | fee_sol
--------+---------------+------------+-----------+----------
 BUY    | 9199996311068 |     2.1270 |    185.42 | 0.070005
```

## Technical Details

### Dependencies Added

```toml
# crates/common/Cargo.toml
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["rt", "time", "sync"] }
reqwest = { version = "0.11", features = ["json"] }
```

### Key Code Changes

#### 1. Main Function - Price Cache Initialization

```rust
// Initialize SOL price cache
let sol_price_cache = SolPriceCache::new();
sol_price_cache.clone().start_updater();
info!("SOL price updater started (fetching every 10 seconds)");
```

#### 2. Transaction Processing - Balance Extraction

```rust
// Find wallet's balance index in the transaction
let wallet_idx = account_keys.iter().position(|k| k == wallet);

// Calculate SOL balance change
let (sol_spent, sol_received) = if let Some(idx) = wallet_idx {
    if idx < pre_balances.len() && idx < post_balances.len() {
        let pre = pre_balances[idx] as f64 / LAMPORTS_PER_SOL;
        let post = post_balances[idx] as f64 / LAMPORTS_PER_SOL;
        let change = post - pre;

        if change < 0.0 {
            (Some(-change), None) // Spent SOL
        } else {
            (None, Some(change)) // Received SOL
        }
    } else {
        (None, None)
    }
} else {
    (None, None)
};
```

#### 3. Event Creation - Complete Data

```rust
let event = db::raw_events::RawEvent {
    amount_in: decoded.token_amount.map(|amt| amt as f64),
    amount_out: match decoded.action {
        Action::Buy => sol_spent,
        Action::Sell => sol_received,
        _ => None,
    },
    price_est: Some(sol_price),
    fee_sol: Some(meta.fee as f64 / LAMPORTS_PER_SOL),
    // ... other fields
};
```

#### 4. Logging - Trade Details

```rust
match decoded.action {
    Action::Buy => {
        if let (Some(tokens), Some(sol)) = (decoded.token_amount, sol_spent) {
            info!("BUY: {} tokens for {:.4} SOL (${:.2})",
                tokens, sol, sol * sol_price);
        }
    }
    Action::Sell => {
        if let (Some(tokens), Some(sol)) = (decoded.token_amount, sol_received) {
            info!("SELL: {} tokens for {:.4} SOL (${:.2})",
                tokens, sol, sol * sol_price);
        }
    }
    _ => {}
}
```

## Analytics Queries

### 1. Recent Trades with USD Values

```sql
SELECT
    action,
    LEFT(wallet, 8) as wallet,
    amount_in as tokens,
    ROUND(amount_out::numeric, 4) as sol,
    ROUND((amount_out * price_est)::numeric, 2) as usd,
    ROUND(fee_sol::numeric, 6) as fee
FROM raw_events
WHERE amount_out IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY ts_ns DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### 2. Wallet Performance

```sql
SELECT
    LEFT(wallet, 8) as wallet,
    COUNT(*) as trades,
    SUM(CASE WHEN action = 'BUY' THEN amount_out ELSE 0 END) as total_sol_spent,
    SUM(CASE WHEN action = 'SELL' THEN amount_out ELSE 0 END) as total_sol_received,
    SUM(CASE WHEN action = 'SELL' THEN amount_out ELSE -amount_out END) as net_sol_pnl
FROM raw_events
WHERE amount_out IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY wallet
ORDER BY net_sol_pnl DESC;
```

### 3. Average Trade Size

```sql
SELECT
    action,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    ROUND(AVG(amount_out)::numeric, 4) as avg_sol,
    ROUND(AVG(amount_out * price_est)::numeric, 2) as avg_usd
FROM raw_events
WHERE amount_out IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY action;
```

## Performance

- **Price Updates**: Background task, no blocking
- **Balance Extraction**: O(n) where n = account_keys length
- **Database Storage**: Batched writes every 5 seconds
- **API Rate Limits**: CoinGecko free tier = 10-50 calls/minute (we use 6/minute)

## Benefits for Copy Trading

With complete SOL tracking, we can now:

1. **Calculate P&L**: Exact profit/loss per wallet in SOL and USD
2. **Identify Winners**: Find wallets with highest win rate and profit
3. **Risk Management**: Set SOL limits per trade based on historical data
4. **Position Sizing**: Copy trades proportionally based on SOL amounts
5. **Fee Analysis**: Track transaction costs and optimize execution
6. **USD Reporting**: Real-time USD values for all trades

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **DONE**: SOL tracking and live pricing
2. **TODO**: Build analytics layer for wallet performance metrics
3. **TODO**: Implement execution bot with risk management
4. **TODO**: Add slippage detection and protection
5. **TODO**: Implement profit-based wallet filtering
