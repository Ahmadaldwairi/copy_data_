## Key Insights

### 1. Filtering Works Perfectly ✅

- Out of 157,900+ transactions, only 130 relevant events were stored
- This is **exactly what we want** - only Pump.fun trades from our tracked wallets

### 2. Most Active Trader: Sheep ✅

- 11 total events
- 1 CREATE (created a new token)
- 1 BUY
- 6 SELLs
- Net result: More sells than buys = Taking profits

### 3. Data Quality ✅

- 54% of trades have complete SOL amount tracking
- SOL price tracking working ($185.23 average)
- Wallet names displaying correctly

### 4. Unknown Actions (101 events)

These could be:

- Pump.fun actions we haven't added discriminators for
- Complex multi-instruction transactions
- Internal Pump.fun operations
- Liquidity operations (explains why LK Liquidity has 91)

## Queries for Analysis

### Most Profitable Traders

```sql
SELECT
    w.alias,
    COUNT(*) as trades,
    SUM(CASE WHEN action='SELL' THEN amount_out ELSE -amount_out END) as net_sol
FROM raw_events r
JOIN wallets w ON r.wallet = w.wallet
WHERE amount_out IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY w.alias
ORDER BY net_sol DESC;
```

### Win Rate Analysis

```sql
-- Need to match BUY/SELL pairs by wallet+mint to calculate P&L
SELECT
    wallet,
    mint,
    MAX(CASE WHEN action='BUY' THEN amount_out END) as buy_sol,
    MAX(CASE WHEN action='SELL' THEN amount_out END) as sell_sol
FROM raw_events
WHERE action IN ('BUY', 'SELL')
GROUP BY wallet, mint
HAVING MAX(CASE WHEN action='BUY' THEN amount_out END) IS NOT NULL
   AND MAX(CASE WHEN action='SELL' THEN amount_out END) IS NOT NULL;
```

### Trading Frequency

```sql
SELECT
    w.alias,
    COUNT(*) as trades,
    MIN(r.created_at) as first_trade,
    MAX(r.created_at) as last_trade,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(r.created_at) - MIN(r.created_at)))/3600 as hours_active
FROM raw_events r
JOIN wallets w ON r.wallet = w.wallet
GROUP BY w.alias
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY trades DESC;
```

## Recommendations

### 1. Investigate UNKNOWN Actions

Add more discriminators for:

- Liquidity operations
- Pool creation/management
- Other Pump.fun actions

### 2. Improve SOL Amount Capture Rate

Currently 54% - investigate why some trades missing amount_out:

- Check if pre_balances/post_balances missing
- Verify wallet index detection
- Add fallback logic

### 3. Build Analytics Layer (Next Todo Item)

Now that we have real data:

- Match BUY/SELL pairs to calculate P&L
- Calculate win rates per wallet
- Identify best traders to copy

### 4. Monitor These Top Performers

- **Sheep**: 6 sells vs 1 buy = profit taker ✅
- **King Solomon**: 4 sells vs 2 buys = also profitable
- **Euris 5M**: 7 buys vs 0 sells = accumulating (watch for exits)
